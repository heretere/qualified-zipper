# Qualified Zipper

### Description

Qualified Zipper is a chromium-based extension with the purpose of zipping up a distribution hosted on https://qualified.io

### Why?

qualified-attach is down and I am tired of manually creating these projects

## Usage

1. Download Latest CRX file from [Releases](https://github.com/heretere/qualified-zipper/releases)
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions` or any other chromium-based browser's extensions page
3. Drag the CRX file onto the page and install it
4. Go to your Qualified Assessment and click on the Qualified Zipper extension icon in the top right and wait
5. Enjoy :)
